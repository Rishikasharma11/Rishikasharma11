 👋 Hi, I’m Rishika, a lover of reading, writing, and all things artistic!
 👀 I’m interested in reading, writing, art, and craft.
 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN stack and finding inner peace through meditation and yoga.
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative tech projects that blend art and technology.
 📫 Connect with me via messages or find me lost in a bookstore!
 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
 ⚡ Fun fact: I'm diving into the tech world like a curious puppy exploring a new park, eager to learn and sniff out all the coding languages!
